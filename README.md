# Striver's A-Z Binary Search Series

This repository contains my solutions and practice problems from Striver's A-Z Binary Search playlist. The goal is to master binary search techniques and solve related problems ranging from easy to hard.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes C++ solutions for various binary search problems.

### Current Problems
- **Lower Bound**: `lower_bound.cpp`
- **Binary Search Implementation**: `binary_search_to_find_x_in_sorted_array.cpp`
- **Maximum Count of Positive & Negative Integers**: `2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer.cpp`

## How to Run

These are standard C++ files. You can compile and run them using `g++` or any C++ IDE.

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
